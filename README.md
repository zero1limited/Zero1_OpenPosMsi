# Zero1_OpenPosMsi

This module will give the ability to take an order in Burnley for example, but ship from Buxton

Instore customer at the till enquires about a product that's not in the current store - asking if it's available elsewhere

Cashier searches for that product on OpenPOS and then PDP will say "Yes, this is available in Buxton"

Customer requests purchase

Cashier adds the product and clicks "Ship to customer" button

This then activates delivery options and magento handles the stock location from MSI settings in admin
